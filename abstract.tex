\section*{FITS and WCS standards in GIS framework}
Due to the increasing amount of available data, Planetary Sciences are evolving rapidly from visual inspection and by-hand analysis to automated
quantitative analyses and only final product visualisation.

Two communities are mainly involved in planetary surface investigations: geologists and astronomers.
The first ones are used to Geographical Information Systems, excelling in interoperability, but historically anchored to Earth's description.
The second ones bring the experience of open and flexible (then performant) formats and softwares in quantitative big data processing, but missing planetary
characterisation.

We propose here a planetary extension of FITS and WCS metadata description, and therefore the insertion of FITS in the GIS interoperability schema.
We will discuss some examples applicable as of now, and some possible extensions for different types of planetary data.
